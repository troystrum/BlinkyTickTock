BlinkyTickTock
=============

BlinkyTickTock- An aesthetically-pleasing second-hand animation clock example for BlinkyTape. Written for Processing.

The colour gradient is changed randomly every minute... or whenever the tiny button on the BlinkyTape itself is pressed.

Based on the current seconds from your computer's clock, it'll start with between 1 and 60 LEDs lit.

It's not overly clever on purpose to keep things simple and hackable.
