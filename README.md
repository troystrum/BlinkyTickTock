BlinkyTickTock
=============

BlinkyTickTock- An aesthetically-pleasing second-hand animation clock example for BlinkyTape. Written for Processing.

The colour gradient is changed randomly every minute... or whenever the tiny button on the BlinkyTape itself is pressed.

It's not overly clever on purpose to keep things simple and hackable.

FIXME: Sometimes the colours chosen at random are very 
similar - or, more often, very white. Because we're rotating 
the colour wheel, this sometimes leads to slightly reddish 
white fading into a slightly bluish white, etc.
